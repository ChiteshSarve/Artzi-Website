        A <b>sketch </b>s a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not
        usually intended as a finished work.[4] A sketch may serve a number of
        purposes: it might record something that the artist sees, it might
        record or develop an idea for later use or it might be used as a quick
        way of graphically demonstrating an image, idea or principle. Sketching
        is the most inexpensive art medium.
      </p>
      <h5><i>Methods</i></h5>
      <p>The two methods in sketching are line drawing and shading.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Line art</b></li>
        <p>
          A line drawing is the most direct means of expression. This type of
          drawing without shading or lightness, is usually the first to be
          attempted by an artist. It may be somewhat limited in effect, yet it
          conveys dimension, movement, structure and mood; it can also suggest
          texture to some extent.
        </p>
        <li><b>Shading</b></li>
        <p>
          Line gives character but shading gives depth and value-it is like
          adding an extra dimension to the sketch.
        </p>
      </ul>

      <h5><i>Advanced techniques</i></h5>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Pencil painting</b></li>
        <p>
          When the pencil is handled almost as if it was a brush, resulting a
          paintlike quality, then the technique is called Pencil Painting.
        </p>
        <li><b>Wash and benzene</b></li>
        <p>
          Starting with a pencil drawing first, then washing over the pencil
          areas with a sable haired water color brush dipping it into the
          benzine is called Wash and Benzene. Benzene does not itself add color,
          but merely modifies the shaded pencil areas.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h5><i>Uses</i></h5>
      <p>
        Sketching is generally a prescribed part of the studies of art students.
        This generally includes making sketches (croquis) from a live model
        whose pose changes every few minutes. A "sketch" usually implies a quick
        and loosely drawn work, while related terms such as study, modello and
        "preparatory drawing" usually refer to more finished and careful works
        to be used as a basis for a final work, often in a different medium, but
        the distinction is imprecise. Underdrawing is drawing underneath the
        final work, which may sometimes still be visible, or can be viewed by
        modern scientific methods such as X-rays. Most visual artists use, to a
        greater or lesser degree, the sketch as a method of recording or working
        out ideas. The sketchbooks of some individual artists have become very
        well known, including those of Leonardo da Vinci and Edgar Degas which
        have become art objects in their own right, with many pages showing
        finished studies as well as sketches. The term "sketchbook" refers to a
        book of blank paper on which an artist can draw (or has already drawn)
        sketches. The book might be purchased bound or might comprise loose
        leaves of sketches assembled or bound together.[11] Sketching is also
        used as a form of communication in areas of product design such as
        industrial design. It can be used to communicate design intent and is
        most widely used in ideation. It can be used to map out floor plans of
        homes. The ability to quickly record impressions through sketching has
        found varied purposes in today's culture. Courtroom sketches record
        scenes and individuals in law courts. Sketches drawn to help authorities
        find or identify wanted people are called composite sketches. Street
        artists in popular tourist areas sketch portraits within minutes
