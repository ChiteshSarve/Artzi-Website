        A <b>cartoon</b> is a type of visual art that is typically drawn,
        frequently animated, in an unrealistic or semi-realistic style. The
        specific meaning has evolved over time, but the modern usage usually
        refers to either: an image or series of images intended for satire,
        caricature, or humor; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of
        illustrations for its animation. Someone who creates cartoons in the
        first sense is called a cartoonist, and in the second sense they are
        usually called an animator. The concept originated in the Middle Ages,
        and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, such as a
        painting, fresco, tapestry, or stained glass window. In the 19th
        century, beginning in Punch magazine in 1843, cartoon came to refer –
        ironically at first – to humorous artworks in magazines and newspapers.
        Then it also was used for political cartoons and comic strips. When the
        medium developed, in the early 20th century, it began to refer to
        animated films which resembled print cartoons.

      <h5><i>Fine art</i></h5>
      <p>
        Christ's Charge to Peter, one of the Raphael Cartoons, a full-size
        cartoon design for a tapestry A cartoon (from Italian: cartone and
        Dutch: karton—words describing strong, heavy paper or pasteboard) is a
        full-size drawing made on sturdy paper as a design or modello for a
        painting, stained glass, or tapestry. Cartoons were typically used in
        the production of frescoes, to accurately link the component parts of
        the composition when painted on damp plaster over a series of days
        (giornate). In media such as stained tapestry or stained glass, the
        cartoon was handed over by the artist to the skilled craftsmen who
        produced the final work. Such cartoons often have pinpricks along the
        outlines of the design so that a bag of soot patted or "pounced" over a
        cartoon, held against the wall, would leave black dots on the plaster
        ("pouncing"). Cartoons by painters, such as the Raphael Cartoons in
        London, and examples by Leonardo da Vinci, are highly prized in their
        own right. Tapestry cartoons, usually colored, were followed with the
        eye by the weavers on the loom
      </p>
      <h5><i>Animation</i></h5>
      <p>
        Because of the stylistic similarities between comic strips and early
        animated films, cartoon came to refer to animation, and the word cartoon
        is currently used in reference to both animated cartoons and gag
        cartoons.[19] While animation designates any style of illustrated images
        seen in rapid succession to give the impression of movement, the word
        "cartoon" is most often used as a descriptor for television programs and
        short films aimed at children, possibly featuring anthropomorphized
        animals,[20] superheroes, the adventures of child protagonists or
        related themes. In the 1980s, cartoon was shortened to toon, referring
        to characters in animated productions. This term was popularized in 1988
        by the combined live-action/animated film Who Framed Roger Rabbit,
        followed in 1990 by the animated TV series Tiny Toon Adventures.
